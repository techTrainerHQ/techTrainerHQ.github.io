                            <br>    
                            <p>I had met the Trainer HQ guys around 18 months ago at their workshop and I knew instantly this was the help and support
                                 I needed to grow my business. I’ve been on the program for only 3 months now and I can say that this has been the best 
                                 decision I have made as I am thriving and moving forward financially and mentally. The support and community is outstanding! <br>

                                I reached a large financial goal within 2 months. This was to conquer the earning of $10,000 in a month. 
                                My income has improved from $9,000 /mth to $11,000 / mth, while still on my own. My coach Lauren has been such a support,
                                 along with all of the team at Trainer HQ.<br>
                                
                                I feel fully supported and believe that I now have the tools and everything else I require to build an awesome business. 
                                These are very exciting times for me and I’m now looking to hire my first trainer.<br>
                                
                                I cannot say enough about how this has helped me across all parts of my life and I’m very happy. <br><br>

                            <br>    
                            <p>I’m from a small country town in southwestern Australia called Manjimup that has around 7,000 – 10,000 residents.
                                 When starting with Trainer HQ I had no structure to my business, no systems in place, no direct debit plan set 
                                 in action and the short story is - it was a mess that earned $1,500 a week. <br>

                                In a few short years since working with Trainer HQ, I have more than doubled my profit (money in my pocket)
                                 from $50K to $120K. I now run a business with systems and have just hired my first employee. My business now earns up to $4500 each week. <br>
                                
                                I have had 3 coaches at Trainer HQ during this time and have gained many things from each of them. I know how to action ideas, 
                                follow up with clients, track my leads, understand my stats and finish the week with a smile on my face. <br>
                                
                                Thanks to Brad, Jase and all my great coaches! <br>

                            <br>    
                            <p>I've been with Trainer HQ for 2 years now and have never looked back. 
                                I came across the program during my first year of being a personal trainer, 
                                during a time where I was barely making any money after paying gym rent. <br>

                                Trainer HQ not only transformed my business but my mindset too. With their help I've 
                                implemented numerous financial tracking systems, developed professional documents and contracts, 
                                worked on my emotional intelligence, and learnt how to not only be a personal trainer but a business owner too. <br>
                                
                                I've literally gone from $0 profit per week to over $2K per week, and have hired two trainers into my team, allowing me to work less and earn more. <br>
                                
                                Without Trainer HQ’s help and belief in my success, I would not be where I am today. The friendships I've made and the experiences
                                 I've been a part of are priceless to me. I wholeheartedly recommend this program and being part of the community. <br>

                            <h1><strong>"Opened my own PT studio and hired my first PT"</strong> </h1>
                            <br>    
                            <p>My experiences with Trainer HQ have been nothing short of fantastic! 
                                Having a coach who has been there already and knows what you need to do 
                                to succeed gives you such an edge over the competition that they aren't
                                 even competition any more! It's not just having a great coach - Trainer
                                  HQ has a community of highly successful trainers all over Australia that 
                                  all want each other to succeed, and there is always support when you ask for it! <br>

                                When I started with Trainer HQ my income was around $1,200-1,500 per week -
                                 so not terrible. Within 6 months though, this number hit $2,500, and within 
                                 12 months it was $3,000 per week. All by myself as a rent based, solo PT in a gym!
                                
                                I’ve now opened my own successful PT studio, and I have an excellent trainer working with me to grow and expand!
                                
                                Quite honestly, I don't know what I would be doing right now if I wasn't for Trainer HQ. I might still be a trainer, but there is a 100% chance that I would not be where I am now. I would most likely be stuck in a rut and just going from week to week without being able to grow, and without being happy where I am. I wouldn't have the knowledge and confidence to charge what I do, and I definitely wouldn't have the confidence to be running my own physical business, let alone opening one in the first place!
                                
                                I recommend that you get on the Trainer HQ program and join the team.<br>

                            <br>    
                            <p>MBefore starting on the program I was earning $300 a week from group classes and a handful
                                 of outdoor PT sessions. Most of the money went back into rent, travel and equipment, 
                                 meaning I really was not making any sort of profit or running a successful business. 
                                 I was also still working full-time, which saw my working hours between my two jobs at around 60-70hrs per week. <br>

                                Since starting on the Trainer HQ program, my business has grown from strength to strength. In my first year
                                 my income was $100,000. I opened my own fitness studio reaching over $3000 per week. My second year on the
                                  program saw my business make $150,000. My third-year projection comes in at over $200,000. <br>
                                
                                I have been able to create a number of revenue streams and have since started to build a team of trainers 
                                around me to further grow the business and our potential to help others on their fitness journeys. <br>
                                
                                I left my full-time job soon after starting with Trainer HQ and now enjoy working less hours each week, 
                                while making more money. I use the business as my tool to create opportunities to live a more fulfilling
                                 and active lifestyle. I love what I do, the community I have built and the team I have around me. I no
                                  longer dread getting up and having to "go to a job". <br>

I am excited to be part of the Trainer HQ community and strive to live the culture they preach each and every day.<br>

                                During this time I have gone through some massive changes in my business. 
                                I went from being a solo trainer doing 30 sessions per week, to doing 60 
                                sessions per week. I then moved to a big box gym and hired 2 trainers and
                                as a team we were doing 120 sessions per week. This allowed me to drop my 
                                own sessions to 40 per week so that I could focus on building the business without dropping income. <br>
                                
                                In only 2 years we have gone from $3K per week to $6-7K per week! <br>

                            <p>We were at a standstill in the business and needed something to get us back on track with some accountability around our numbers and marketing strategies. <br>

                                Our experience with Trainer HQ has been informative and extremely enjoyable. The initial setup with Brad gave us a 
                                “wake up” call with regards to our lack of accountability around our numbers. It also helped us to implement systems
                                 to keep us on track of everything down to the dollar. <br>
                                
                                In 6 short weeks on the program, we have increased our weekly revenue by $1,620 
                                with the help of Trainer HQ’s guidance around marketing, lead generation and financial
                                 tracking. This has made a huge difference in our lives and the business! <br>
                                
                                We expanded our gym to a bigger premises with significant overhead increases 6 
                                months prior to starting with Trainer HQ, and subsequently we found ourselves struggling financially. <br>
                                
                                However, within just 6 weeks of starting the program, we have now diminished the financial
                                 stress and we are now taking home a comfortable weekly profit.<br>

                            <br>    
                            <p>After following the guys for a while in February 2019, 
                                I finally made the decision to jump on board with Trainer HQ.
                                 After watching my friend excel in his PT business I knew I had 
                                 to get on it! Many obstacles came my way but I was able to overcome 
                                 them with the help of my coach and the Trainer HQ team. <br>

                                My goal was to earn 6 figures which I was on the way to smashing.
                                 I have now relocated and am feeling confident that I'll soon be 
                                 back on track. Tim (my coach) has been amazing in helping me implement
                                  strategies and guiding me in the right direction. <br>
                                
                                The best thing about Trainer HQ is their support. Not only do I

                            <p>I have been a member of the Trainer HQ family since June 2018 and I’ve attended the Millionaire’s Retreat, 
                                Business Building workshops, Ignite Bali, and the End of Year Workshop. Throughout all of these events the 
                                focus has been fantastic and I have been able to tap into my personal drive and power to achieve the success I truly want and desire. <br>

                                I’ve gone from $500 p/w to $3,500 p/w and still growing! <br>
                                
                                This has made a massive difference to many areas of my life. I have a better 
                                relationship with my wife as we aren’t constantly talking about money stresses.
                                 I have better relationships with my clients as I am able to provide a better service and environment for them to achieve their ultimate success. <br>
                                
                                The biggest impact has been on me personally. I’ve allowed myself to remain calm under pressure, to back myself in situations
                                 that I would not have done so before, and to be able to successfully run my business with minimal stresses. <br>

                                who has guided me throughout the Trainer HQ journey so far. Michael's ability to understand a situation 
                                and create a proactive outcome has helped me to make many tough decisions. <br>
